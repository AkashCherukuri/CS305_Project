Our project is about analysing different BTB modules with different Branch Predictors.

The Project/Results Folder contains the results of the experiments we have done and it also contains python codes to plot graphs from the results obtained.

MBTB-ICCD-master is the repo given. We have done experiments on that and had put the results in the Project directory.

Research Papers folder contains the refereces we used for the BTB designs.
